# Codes
<h4>Program 1)Write down a java program to print even and odd numbers series respectively
from two threads: t1 and t2 synchronizing on a shared object
Let t1 print message “ping — >” and t2 print message “,—-pong”.
Take as command line arguments, the following inputs to the program:
Sleep Interval for thread t1
Write down a java program to print even and odd numbers series respectively from two
threads: t1 and t2 synchronizing on a shared object

Let t1 print message “ping — >” and t2 print message “,—-pong”.

Output should be
-: 1
d: 1
e: 2
f: 1

  Program 2)Using methods charAt() & length() of String class, write a program to print the
frequency of each character in a string.
“Hello friend”
  </h4>
  <h4>
  Program 3)We have a Letter or a word then we need add some letters to it and need to find out shortest palindrome
For example we take "S": S will be the shortest palindrome string.
If we take "xyz": zyxyz will be the shortest palindrome string
So we need to add some characters to the given string or character and find out what will be the shortest palindrome string by using simple java program.

 Program 4) Write a simple code to identify given linked list is palindrome or not by using stack.
First take a Stack. Traverse through each node of the linked list and push each node value to Stack.
Once the traversal & copying is done, iterate through linked list from head node again.
In each iteration, pop one stack element and compare with node value in respective iteration. It is expected to match stack popped value with node value.
In case of all matches, its a palindrome. Any one element mismatch makes it not a palindrome.

<h4>Program 5)
  Test Case 1:
If a linked listis: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
The value of size k is 2
Then the linked list looks like: 2 → 1 → 4 → 3 → 6 → 5 → 8 → 7

Test Case 2:
If a linked listis: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8
The value of size k is 3
Then the linked list looks like: 3 → 2 → 1 → 6 → 5 → 4 → 8 → 7

<h4>
  Program 6)A user will input two strings, and we find if one of the strings is a sub sequence of the other. Program prints “yes” if either the first string is a sub sequence of the second string or the second string is a sub sequence of the first string.
Assume that, the length of the first string is smaller than or equal to the length of the second string.
